  <h1>Welcome to {{ configuration.name }}!</h1>
  <p>
    This event is organized by {{ joinOrganizers(configuration.organizers) }}, and features Jeopardy-style 
    cybersecurity challenges from different categories. This event lasts {{ computeDuration(configuration) }}, during 
    which your goal is to rack up as many points as possible by solving challenges presented by the organizers.
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="configuration.scoring === ApiEventScoringMode.Static">
    Solving each challenge will net you a fixed amount of points, therefore, to scale the leaderboard, you have to 
    solve challenges faster than others.
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="configuration.scoring === ApiEventScoringMode.Jeopardy">
    Solving challenges will net you points, however, each challenge's score scales dynamically with the number of 
    participants who solved it. This means that if the majority of participants solve a challenge, it will ultimately 
    be worth less points than a challenge that was solved by only a handful of people. It's important to remember that 
    points continue to scale after you solve the challenge, and your total is updated to reflect that. This means that 
    solving easy challenges quickly will not guarantee your position at the top of the leaderboard!
  </p>
  <p *ngIf="configuration.scoring === ApiEventScoringMode.FirstComeFirstServe">
    Solving challenges will net you points, but challenge scores scale dynamically with the number of participants who 
    solved it. Any points you gain, however, are yours to keep. To maintain the top position on the leaderboard, you 
    have to solve as many challenges as you can, as quickly as you can.
