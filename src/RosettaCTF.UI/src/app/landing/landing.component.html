<ng-container *ngIf="configuration$ | async; let configuration">
    <h1>Welcome to {{ configuration.name }}!</h1>
    <p>
        This event is organized by {{ joinOrganizers(configuration.organizers) }}, and features Jeopardy-style
        cybersecurity challenges from different categories. This event lasts {{ computeDuration(configuration) }},
        during which your goal is to rack up as many points as possible by solving challenges presented by the
        organizers.
    </p>
    <p *ngIf="configuration.scoring === ApiEventScoringMode.Static">
        Solving each challenge will net you a fixed amount of points, therefore, to scale the leaderboard, you have to
        solve challenges faster than others.
    </p>
    <p *ngIf="configuration.scoring === ApiEventScoringMode.Jeopardy">
        Solving challenges will net you points, however, each challenge's score scales dynamically with the number of
        participants who solved it. This means that if the majority of participants solve a challenge, it will
        ultimately be worth less points than a challenge that was solved by only a handful of people. It's important to
        remember that points continue to scale after you solve the challenge, and your total is updated to reflect that.
        This means that solving easy challenges quickly will not guarantee your position at the top of the leaderboard!
    </p>
    <p *ngIf="configuration.scoring === ApiEventScoringMode.FirstComeFirstServe">
        Solving challenges will net you points, but challenge scores scale dynamically with the number of participants
        who solved it. Any points you gain, however, are yours to keep. To maintain the top position on the leaderboard,
        you have to solve as many challenges as you can, as quickly as you can.
    </p>


    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't cheat</li>
        <li>Dunno what else to write here</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How-to</h2>
    <p>
        To begin solving the challenges, you need to log in through Discord, and join or create a team. The challenges
        will become available once the event starts, and will accept responses until it ends. Hints for challenges will
        be released automatically after a certain time has passed, based on difficulty. The hints for harder challenges
        were set to release sooner.
    </p>
